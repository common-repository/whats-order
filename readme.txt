Automatically creates a shopping cart from images inserted in posts a/o articles.
Order requests are sent to seller by Whatsapp messages.

== Description ==

This plugin generates a simple shopping cart from the images contained in pages and articles.
Items are loaded in the database in order to get the information (i.e. description and price) of the items added to the cart.

Images must have the custom attribute *wso-item* whose value is the item code associated with the image.
(for instance, the attribute-value couple can be add to images by the 'Attributes' option of the Edit Image dashboard of Elementor Pro)
